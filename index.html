  <!-- Step 1: Experiment Process -->
  <div class="process-step">
    <h2>1. Experimental Procedure</h2>
    <p>The production of herbal ginger tea involves several key steps, each designed to extract the beneficial properties of ginger while creating a flavorful and therapeutic tea. Below is a breakdown of each stage of the procedure:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Selection of Ginger:</strong> Fresh ginger roots were selected, ensuring they were free from damage and disease. Quality control at this stage is crucial as it ensures the final product's flavor and potency.</li>
      <li><strong>Cleaning and Peeling:</strong> The ginger roots were thoroughly washed to remove any dirt or chemicals. The skin was peeled to enhance the extraction of the bioactive compounds.</li>
      <li><strong>Slicing:</strong> The peeled ginger was sliced into thin pieces, increasing the surface area for more efficient extraction of essential oils and bioactive compounds.</li>
      <li><strong>Boiling:</strong> The ginger slices were boiled in water to extract the bioactive compounds. The boiling time and water temperature were controlled to prevent degradation of the active compounds.</li>
      <li><strong>Straining:</strong> Once the ginger was boiled and its compounds extracted, the tea was strained to remove the solid ginger pieces, leaving behind a clear, flavorful liquid.</li>
      <li><strong>Final Product Creation:</strong> The strained tea was allowed to cool to a drinkable temperature. Sweeteners such as honey or lemon were added based on preference. The final product was tested for taste, aroma, and therapeutic effects.</li>
    </ul>

  <!-- Step 2: Results Comparison -->
  <div class="results-comparison">
    <h2>2. Results Comparison</h2>
    <p>In this section, we compare the results obtained from different preparation conditions. Various factors, such as boiling time, water temperature, and ginger quantity, were varied to assess their impact on the flavor, aroma, and health benefits of the tea. The following graphs illustrate the results of these comparisons:</p>
    <div class="graph-container">
      <img src="images/graph1.jpg" alt="Graph 1: Flavor Intensity Based on Boiling Time" class="graph">
      <img src="images/graph2.jpg" alt="Graph 2: Health Benefits Based on Ginger Quantity" class="graph">
    </div>
    <p>The graphs demonstrate the variation in the effectiveness and flavor of the ginger tea under different conditions. For example, longer boiling times led to a stronger flavor and higher concentration of active compounds like gingerol, which contributes to the tea's therapeutic properties.</p>
    <p>Additionally, increasing the ginger quantity improved the potency of the tea, especially in terms of its anti-inflammatory and digestive benefits. However, a higher ginger concentration also resulted in a more intense flavor, which some participants found too strong.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Step 3: Organic Compounds and Chemical Changes -->
  <div class="organic-compounds">
    <h2>3. Organic Compounds</h2>
    <p>The final ginger tea contains a variety of organic compounds, each contributing to its health benefits. Some of the key compounds found in ginger include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Gingerol:</strong> The main bioactive compound in ginger, responsible for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. It also contributes to the characteristic spiciness and warmth of the tea.</li>
      <li><strong>Shogaol:</strong> Formed from gingerol during the drying or boiling process, shogaol has potent anti-inflammatory properties and is effective for alleviating nausea and digestive issues.</li>
      <li><strong>Zingiberene:</strong> A sesquiterpene that provides ginger with its distinct aroma and has antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If any chemical changes were observed during the production process, they are noted below:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The gingerol compound undergoes a transformation into shogaol when exposed to prolonged heat during the boiling process.</li>
      <li>During extraction, some volatile oils and compounds are lost due to evaporation, which can affect the final flavor and aroma.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <!-- Step 4: Analysis and Discussion -->
  <div class="analysis">
    <h2>4. Analysis of Results</h2>
    <p>In this section, we analyze the results of the experiment. Our hypothesis was that the flavor intensity and health benefits of the ginger tea would increase with longer boiling times and higher ginger quantities. The results largely support this hypothesis, with both longer boiling times and increased ginger quantities leading to a more potent and flavorful tea.</p>
    <p>However, there were some trade-offs. The increased concentration of ginger led to a more intense flavor, which, while beneficial for some, was too strong for others. Additionally, the longer the boiling time, the more the tea became bitter, which impacted the overall taste.</p>
    <p>We also identified a few experimental errors during the process:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Inconsistencies in water temperature affected the extraction rate of bioactive compounds, leading to some variation in the potency of the final product.</li>
      <li>Imprecise slicing of ginger roots resulted in uneven extraction, with some batches having stronger flavors and higher concentrations of active compounds than others.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To improve future experiments, it is recommended to standardize the slicing process, maintain precise temperature control, and test additional methods for flavor enhancement, such as infusing the tea with other herbs or spices.</p>

  <!-- Conclusion -->
  <div class="conclusion">
    <h2>5. Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In conclusion, the experiment successfully demonstrated that ginger tea can be a potent and flavorful herbal beverage. By adjusting boiling time and ginger quantity, we were able to produce a tea with enhanced therapeutic benefits. However, future research is needed to further refine the process, minimize variations, and improve the overall consistency and taste of the final product.</p>
    <p>The study also highlighted the importance of understanding the chemical composition of ginger and how different preparation methods can impact the concentration of active compounds. Future work could explore the addition of other herbal ingredients to enhance the flavor and therapeutic effects of ginger tea.</p>
